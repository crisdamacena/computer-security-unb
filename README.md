## Installation

To run a C executable in the Linux terminal, follow these steps:

Make sure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). If you haven't already installed it, you can do so on many Linux distributions using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu and Debian, you can install GCC with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

After installing the compiler, create or obtain your C source code and save it with a ".c" extension. For example, you can create a file named "my_program.c."

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the C file is located. You can use the "cd" command to do this. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Compile the source code using GCC. The basic command to compile a C file is as follows:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c
```

This will generate an executable file named "my_program" (or the name you specified after the -o option).

Now that you have the executable file, you can run it in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
./my_program
```

Make sure to include "./" before the executable's name to indicate that you are running a file in the current directory.
